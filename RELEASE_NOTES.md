OtherPowers ii-Agent — posture-v1

This release establishes a stable posture for the OtherPowers ii-Agent.

The system is oriented around care, refusal, and non-coercive operation rather than optimization or throughput. Silence, pause, and non-action are treated as valid outcomes.

Stasis and refusal are intentional behaviors. They are surfaced through tests and enforced through explicit interfaces, not hidden logic or urgency.

Memory is append-only. Lineage is preserved without summarization, overwrite, or identity extraction. The system remains functional even when memory cannot be written.

Invariant refusals are encoded as tests. Ranking, forced synthesis, surveillance escalation, extractive logging, override pressure, and scope creep are structurally refused.

Pulse behavior is descriptive and non-linear. Multiple conditions may coexist. Output does not assume progress.

This release is public for accountability, not completeness. Public does not mean finished.

## Acknowledgements & Inspirations

This posture is informed by thinkers, organizers, and artists whose work centers care, abolition, plurality, and resistance to supremacist systems. Their contributions are not sources to extract from, but orientations we remain in relation with.
