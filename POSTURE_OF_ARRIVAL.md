The Posture of Arrival

This document describes how to enter and inhabit the OtherPowers ii-Agent.

It is not a set of requirements.
It is not a contribution checklist.
It describes the posture of arrival.

If you are here, you are entering a shared space, not only a codebase. The intent of this document is to support collaboration that is careful, durable, and respectful of impact.

1. Orientation

OtherPowers ii-Agent does not optimize for speed by default. It prioritizes context, care, and long-term coherence.

You are welcome here if you are interested in building systems that can slow down, avoid harm, and remain understandable to the people they affect.

If you are seeking to maximize throughput, rankings, or rapid abstraction, this environment may feel slower than expected. That is by design.

2. Forms of Participation

We value participation that contributes to the health of the system over time.

This can include:

Choosing not to act when action would reduce clarity or plurality

Improving language in code or documentation to reduce ambiguity or harm

Noticing areas of excess complexity, demand, or strain

Recording why certain paths were intentionally not taken

Silence, pause, and restraint are considered valid forms of participation.

3. Conditions of Presence

The system is maintained through alignment rather than enforcement.

To keep the field coherent:

Treat silence as a possible signal, not an error

Allow multiple perspectives to coexist without forcing resolution

Design with decay and revision in mind

Respect periods of pause or stasis

4. Working With the Code

The codebase is intended to be readable, intentional, and maintainable.

Tests describe expected behavior under pressure

Prefer changes that are legible to non-specialists

When integrating with faster or legacy systems, take care to preserve context and intent

5. Departure

You may step away from the project or remove your contributions at any time.

Participation does not create obligation.
Departure does not require explanation.

Closing

OtherPowers ii-Agent is built to support thoughtful collaboration over time.

If you arrive with care, awareness of impact, and a willingness to listen, you are already aligned.

Why this works (brief, factual)

No activist or militant language

No abstraction beyond standard professional norms

Reads as a calm collaboration guide

Compatible with institutional review and future contributors

Does not conflict with any existing code, tests, or governance structures

## Acknowledgements & Inspirations

This posture is informed by thinkers, organizers, and artists whose work centers care, abolition, plurality, and resistance to supremacist systems. Their contributions are not sources to extract from, but orientations we remain in relation with.
