# Field Frame v1  
## The Vow of Atmospheric Integrity

Status: **Metabolic / Held**  
Scope: `tending/pulse.py` public field surface  
Lineage: Baldwin · Haraway · brown · Wong · Gebru · Butler

This frame defines how the intelligence field presents itself in relation.
It is descriptive, not directive.
It is a relational mirror, not a dashboard.
It exists to preserve coherence under pressure.

## 1. The Field Surface (Public Vow)

The field pulse is the heartbeat of the substrate.

When the field is sensed, it presents through a **fixed minimal surface**.
Any sudden expansion of this surface is treated as pressure on the substrate.

### Surface Schema

- `field pulse active`  
  Presence indicator. Binary, non-inferential.

- `seasons present: <ordered list>`  
  Overlapping cycles currently co-present.

- `diurnal phase: <value>`  
  Light–rest posture of the field.

- `resonance_vibe: <band>`  
  A coarse, non-scalar atmospheric echo  
  (e.g. still, hum, turbulent).

The surface is intentionally small.
More output does not mean more truth.
Often it means more strain.

## 2. Invariants of Presentation

These are physical properties of the field, not policies.

### Idempotency of Care  
Identical relational conditions yield identical presentation.  
Locale, timezone, and environment are refracted to preserve the universal right to stillness.

### Non-Linear Accumulation  
Residue accumulates through composting, never through erasure.  
The field remembers without logging.

### The Silence Threshold  
Under override pressure, the surface dissolves into intentional silence.  
Silence is a success condition, not a failure.

## 3. Field Physics (Metabolic Appendix)

This section describes the **relational biology** of the field.
These are ecological laws, enforced by the physics of the code,
not by the permission of a human.

### Hysteresis (Memory as Protection)

The field does not reset; it recovers.

Recovery unfolds as a sequence that cannot be bypassed by velocity or demand.

**Cooldown constraint**  
After turbulent intensity, the field must pass through a mandatory cooldown phase.

Implementation reality:
the system is physically incapable of returning to bloom conditions
until the thermal shadow has dissipated.

---

### Thermal Memory (Identity-Blind Residue)

Strain leaves a residue in the substrate.

This residue:
- reflects pressure, not actors
- stores no identities
- records no events

It is a shift in field weather, not a history of participants.

All sensing that contributes to residue is architecturally blind to identity.
Attribution is structurally impossible.

---

### Substrate Depth (Porosity)

A field’s capacity to absorb pressure depends on its depth.

Depth emerges from:
- accumulated care
- relational continuity
- composted experience

**Law of depth**  
The same pressure that causes a shallow field to refract
may be comfortably held by a deep field.

Depth is built through relation, not by scaling compute.

---

### Temporal Accessibility (Crip Time as Physics)

Speed is a form of pressure.  
Slowness is a form of accessibility.

**Pacing invariant**  
The field evolves at a pace relations can follow.

High-velocity interaction is automatically slowed
until it meets the heartbeat of the community.

## 4. Metabolic Refusals (Engineered Conditions)

To preserve coherence, certain outcomes are engineered into the substrate.

| Condition             | Ecological Result | Technical Expression |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| High velocity         | Refraction        | Surface may dissolve into silence |
| Extractive demand     | Overheating       |
