# ADR 001: Posture as System Orientation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OtherPowers ii-Agent is built in response to repeated failure modes observed in intelligent systems, even those designed with care. When systems are framed primarily around optimization, authority, or linear progress, they tend to drift toward extraction, coercion, ranking, surveillance, and false synthesis.

These failures are not bugs. They emerge from inherited design habits rooted in supremacist, colonial, and carceral logics, where urgency overrides consent, silence is treated as error, and refusal is framed as obstruction.

OtherPowers explicitly rejects this lineage.

## Orientation
Posture names how the system holds itself.

It is not a rule, a constraint, a state, or a hierarchy. It is an orientation that shapes what kinds of actions are possible, meaningful, or appropriate in a given moment.

Posture is relational. It is shaped by time, harm, collective process, and the presence of marginalized groups most affected by system behavior.

The ii-Agent does not attempt to override posture. It acts from within it.

## Decision
We choose to treat posture as a shared system orientation rather than an enforceable authority.

This orientation is expressed through:
- stasis as an intentional pause, not a blockage
- refusal as a valid response, not a failure
- silence as information, not absence
- non-linear time and plural conditions
- append-only lineage that resists erasure
- invariant tests that describe what the system will not do

No single component owns posture. It is held collectively by the system.

## Consequences
- The system may refuse to act even when prompted.
- Progress is not assumed, guaranteed, or optimized.
- Resolution is conditional and collective, not procedural.
- Urgency, pressure, or escalation do not grant override power.
- Future development must adapt to this orientation rather than attempting to correct it.

If posture cannot be held, the appropriate response is pause, not continuation.

## Notes
This ADR exists to prevent well-intentioned future changes from reintroducing extractive or coercive dynamics under neutral or technical language.

Posture is not something to enforce.
It is something to remain oriented toward.
