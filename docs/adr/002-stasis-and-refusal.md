# ADR 002: Stasis and Refusal as Care-Oriented System Responses

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In dominant technical systems, interruption is treated as error, refusal is framed as failure, and stasis is interpreted as blockage or inefficiency. These interpretations emerge from extractive and supremacist design traditions that prioritize throughput, control, and optimization over care and collective safety.

In practice, this framing causes harm. Systems are pressured to continue acting even when conditions are unsafe, unclear, or contested. Marginalized groups bear the consequences of this pressure disproportionately.

OtherPowers rejects the assumption that action is always preferable to pause.

## Orientation
Stasis and refusal describe how the system cares for itself and others under conditions of potential harm.

They are not defensive mechanisms.
They are not enforcement tools.
They are not exceptional cases.

They are normal, expected responses when the system encounters:
- unresolved harm
- contested invariants
- coercive pressure
- attempts to override collective process
- conditions where action would amplify risk

Stasis creates space.
Refusal communicates boundaries.
Both protect against escalation.

## Decision
We intentionally design stasis and refusal as primary system responses.

This is expressed through:
- stasis gates that pause action without collapsing context
- refusal paths that surface limits without moralizing
- tests that assert what the system will not proceed through
- resolution processes that require time, quorum, and care
- an absence of forced progress or override channels

Stasis does not demand resolution.
Refusal does not demand justification.

They exist to reduce harm, not to accelerate outcomes.

## Consequences
- The system may remain paused indefinitely.
- Some requests will never be fulfilled.
- Silence may be the most appropriate output.
- Attempts to force action will be met with non-action.
- Safety is prioritized over responsiveness.

These consequences are intentional.

They reflect a commitment to abolitionist, anti-supremacist design that centers those most impacted by system behavior.

## Notes
Stasis and refusal are often reframed by future contributors as problems to solve.

This ADR exists to clarify that they are signals to respect.

If future work seeks to eliminate stasis or refusal, that work is incompatible with this system’s orientation.
