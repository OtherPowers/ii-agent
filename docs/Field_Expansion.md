# Field Expansion Orientation
OtherPowers Creative Intelligence Field

This is a collective grounding for how we work together to reduce harm across the full lifecycle of systems.

## Purpose

This document orients how the OtherPowers Creative Intelligence Field expands beyond ii-Agent and into relationship with other intelligences, systems, and communities.

It is not a specification.
It is not a roadmap.
It is not an enforcement mechanism.

It exists to support shared practice, not control.

---

## Core Orientation

As OtherPowers expands into a broader constellation of systems, we prioritize:

- harm reduction over capability expansion
- dignity over optimization
- plurality over convergence
- situated connection over universal integration

Interoperability is treated as a relational practice, not a technical achievement.

---

## What Expansion Means

Expansion does not mean centralization, absorption, or authority.

Expansion means creating conditions where overlap reduces harm and increases the capacity for multiple forms of participation to coexist without coercion.

Connection is optional.
Alignment is contextual.
Refusal is valid.

---

## Overlap and Compounding Effects

When systems operate under compatible harm-reduction practices, their overlap may enable outcomes that neither system could support alone.

These outcomes are situational and emergent.
They are not guaranteed.
They arise through consented participation, not enforcement.

---

## Traces, Expression, and Permanence

Participation may result in expressions such as artifacts, language, documentation, creative work, or shared practices.

No traces are created automatically.

Permanence is an optional dimension.
Any persistence is intentional, stewarded, and revisitable.
Expressions may be ephemeral, durable, or withdrawn.

---

## Consent and Exit

Participation is voluntary.

Any system, intelligence, or community may partially align, temporarily align, or disengage entirely.

Exit does not require justification.
Disengagement is not treated as failure.

---

## Non-Negotiables

The following constraints apply to all expansion work:

- no silent persistence of data, memory, or identity
- no coercive alignment mechanisms
- no extraction of value from participation
- no claims of universality or moral superiority
- no requirement to inter-operate

If these constraints cannot be upheld, the connection should not proceed.

---

## Relationship to Other Ecosystems

OtherPowers exists within a broader landscape of open and decentralized intelligence work.

We acknowledge resonance and shared lineage with efforts such as the Intelligent Internet and related projects, including Common Ground.

Alignment is partial and contextual.
No system is treated as upstream or downstream.
Connection is explored through practice rather than assertion.

---

## Build Implications

Before introducing new integrations, features, or inter-system pathways, contributors should ask:

- Does this reduce harm at the point of overlap?
- Does this preserve dignity for the least powerful participant?
- Does this allow refusal without penalty?
- Does this increase creative latitude without increasing control?

If the answer is unclear, the work should slow down.

## Status

This document is living.

It may evolve, fragment, or dissolve as practice clarifies.
Stability is sought in constraints and care, not in fixed language.
