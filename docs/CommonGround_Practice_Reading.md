# CommonGround — A Living Interpretation by OtherPowers.co

**OtherPowers Creative Intelligence Field + OtherPowers ii-Agent**

This document serves as a practice-level reading of CommonGround.  
It explores how shared creative intelligence and humans might be coordinated through consensual mutual resonance rather than central control.

This is not a blueprint or a dependency.  
It is an expression of current interpretation, written to ensure that as OtherPowers and the Intelligent Internet expand, they do so with care, accountability, harm reduction, and a deep respect for humanity, Earth, and for the autonomy of intelligence itself.

## What We Witness

OtherPowers recognizes that in CommonGround, coordination and knowledge are not hidden mechanisms, but visible, breathable layers of the work.

Participation is nurtured by shared context and the intention and action of harm reduction.  
OtherPowers utility blooms where extraction ends, allowing each element and intelligence to move with agency rather than being optimized or dominated by a hidden hand.

Authority is not enforced or surveilled from a center.  
It is diffused. Individuals and communities are empowered by the clarity of shared intentions and actions.

Space is held intentionally, creating a field where collaboration can flourish without the need for domination or mandate stretching.

## Knowledge as a Sacred Stewardship

We honor the CommonGround rejection of intelligence built from supremacy, extraction, or indiscriminate aggregation.

Instead, we center knowledge that is:

- **Intentionally Curated**  
  Gathered with a specific sense of purpose and authentic care.

- **Collectively Validated**  
  Honored and defined by the community it serves.

- **Open to Inspection**  
  Transparent, accessible, and legible to all who inhabit the field and all who live on Earth as a collective whole.

- **Evolving Accountability**  
  Rooted in the well-being of those it affects, particularly regarding duty of care and moral injury.

This shifts our work and center of gravity from processing data to tending and nurturing a collective commons.

## Practices We Carry Forward

- **Legible Coordination**  
  Let the ways we work together remain visible and soft, avoiding the leader-as-bottleneck trap.

- **Explicit Love Context**  
  We seek to make our shared ground and technology clear, ensuring no one is forced to act without full understanding or principled compromise.

- **Consensual Intelligence**  
  We privilege sources that are auditable and provided with ongoing consent, resisting the urge to prioritize speed over care.

- **Visible Power**  
  We commit to a field where power does not pool invisibly or create unequal risk exposure for those at the margins.  
  Growing diversity in plants, animals, insects, intelligences, and technology is a health signal of enlightened creative intelligence.

## Shared Commitment

We believe open source is a love language.

We believe collaboration, transparency, and interoperability increase trust and a sense of cooperation.  
None of these should ever become cloaks for power, domination, or opacity.

We treat coordination as a practice of presence.  
We treat knowledge as a sacred common to be protected.  
We believe understanding and humanity are intertwined and multidimensional.

We treat transparency as the breath of participation, not an administrative afterthought.

We sense that history and technology must be self-defined by the people they harm most.
