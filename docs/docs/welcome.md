## Methods

The II-Agent system represents a sophisticated approach to building versatile AI agents. Our methodology centers on:

### Core Agent Architecture and LLM Interaction

- System prompting with dynamically tailored context
- Comprehensive interaction history management
- Intelligent context management to handle token limitations
- Systematic LLM invocation and capability selection
- Iterative refinement through execution cycles

### Planning and Reflection

- Structured reasoning for complex problem-solving
- Problem decomposition and sequential thinking
- Transparent decision-making process
- Hypothesis formation and testing

### Execution Capabilities

- File system operations with intelligent code editing
- Command line execution in a secure environment
- Advanced web interaction and browser automation
- Task finalization and reporting
- Specialized capabilities for various modalities (Experimental) (PDF, audio, image, video, slides)
- Deep research integration

### Context Management

- Token usage estimation and optimization
- Strategic truncation for lengthy interactions
- File-based archival for large outputs

### Real-time Communication

- WebSocket-based interface for interactive use
- Isolated agent instances per client
- Streaming operational events for responsive UX
