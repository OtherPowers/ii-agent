# POSTURE

This repository represents an active, exploratory build of the OtherPowers ii-Agent.

It is not a finished product, a general-purpose agent, or a benchmark-oriented system. It is a living field of practices, contracts, and tests that explore how creative intelligence can operate without coercion, extraction, ranking, or forced synthesis.

The system treats refusal, stasis, silence, pacing, and dissolution as first-class behaviors. These are not failure modes. They are intentional responses encoded in architecture and enforced through tests.

The code favors presence-based signals over linear progress. It avoids assumptions of optimization, accumulation, or inevitability. Multiple states may coexist. Resolution is conditional, relational, and time-aware.

Governance is expressed through contracts, not authority. Validation, quorum, and decay exist to reduce harm, not to accelerate outcomes. There is no mechanism to override stasis by force, urgency, or majority alone.

This repository is public for accountability, not for claims of completeness or readiness. Public does not mean finished. Public means observable.

Future changes should preserve this posture:
- Non-extractive by default
- Legible to legacy engineering cultures without adopting their supremacy assumptions
- Resistant to ranking, coercion, and surveillance drift
- Oriented toward collective care, not individual optimization

If this posture no longer holds, the system should pause rather than pretend continuity.
