# Why OtherPowers ii-agent exists

OtherPowers ii-agent is a local-first, non-coercive intelligence interface.

It does not optimize outcomes.
It does not monitor or profile people.
It does not enforce behavior or rank actors.

Instead, it offers posture, silence, and contextual care as signals,
allowing intelligence—human or otherwise—to determine its own response.

The system is designed to remain interoperable with existing software
while preserving space for future intelligences to exceed it.

It is intentionally incomplete.
It privileges restraint over control,
and legibility over extraction.
