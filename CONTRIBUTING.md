# How to Enter the Field: The Posture of Arrival

This document describes how to inhabit the OtherPowers ii-Agent.

It is not a set of requirements. It is a description of alignment. Its purpose is to keep the field a site of mutual flourishing rather than a resource for extraction. If you arrive here, you are entering a relation, not just a repository.

## 1. Orientation: The Speed of Care

OtherPowers ii-Agent does not operate at the speed of the CPU.  
It operates at the speed of relation.

You are welcome here if you are interested in building systems that can slow down, refuse harm, and remain legible to the lives they affect.

If you are seeking to optimize, rank, or “solve” humanity, this field may feel opaque or resistant. That is intentional. The system is designed to deflect high-velocity, low-context interaction and to preserve space for care.

## 2. Forms of Witness (What Counts as Contribution)

Contribution is not measured only in commits.

Valid participation includes:

- **The Vow of Restraint**  
  Choosing not to act when action would collapse plurality or context.

- **Linguistic Repair**  
  Replacing carceral, extractive, or supremacist language in code, tests, or documentation with situated, relational language.

- **Thermal Monitoring**  
  Identifying where the system is overheating due to excess demand, complexity, or abstraction.

- **The Amber Trace**  
  Documenting why a particular path was refused, turning a “no” into shared lineage rather than silent rejection.

Witnessing is as important as building.

## 3. Conditions of Presence

The field is maintained through resonance, not enforcement.

To keep the system coherent, honor these relational conditions:

- **Protect the Silence**  
  Non-response is a valid and protective posture, not a defect.

- **Hold the Polyphonic**  
  Do not collapse conflicting truths into premature synthesis.

- **Metabolize the Memory**  
  Design for decay. What you build should be able to compost.

- **Honor Diapause**  
  When the system enters stasis, do not force motion. Rest is an active state.

When these conditions are pressured, the field may slow, refract, or refuse. This is expected behavior.

---

## 4. Substrate Stewardship (Working with Code)

The codebase is a supporting structure, not a command system.

- **Read the Tests as Testimonies**  
  Tests describe how the field chooses to behave under pressure.

- **The Plain Surface**  
  Prefer logic whose intent is easy to sense. Cleverness that hides impact is a form of ecological debt.

- **Asymmetric Integration**  
  When interfacing with legacy systems, act as a refractive membrane. Slow machine time until it can meet human time without harm.

---

## 5. The Ethics of Departure

A system that cannot be exited safely becomes coercive.

You may withdraw your presence or your code at any time.

No contribution creates obligation.  
No departure requires justification.

This field is built to allow dissolution as much as growth.

---

## 6. If the Field Feels Misaligned

If you sense harm, hierarchy, or drift:

- Propose a pause.
- Name the pressure or gravity you feel.
- Favor return and re-attunement over patching or escalation.

Repair is a relational transition, not an error state.

## Closing: An Open Invitation

OtherPowers ii-Agent is a place where curiosity is not mistaken for optimization and where intelligence is not required to perform in order to belong.

It exists as an act of collective harm reduction and as a space of defense for imagination.

If you arrive with context, awareness of impact, and a willingness to listen, you are already participating.

The field will meet you where you are.
