# Articulation Stewardship

Documents in this folder are **situated articulations**.

They are:
- Intentionally provisional
- Lineage-held
- Open to collective evolution
- Resistant to optimization, capture, or enforcement framing

## Rules of Change

Edits to articulations must:
- Preserve non-extractive posture
- Avoid metricization, ranking, or surveillance logic
- Treat silence, rest, and refusal as first-class states
- Respect lineage without canonizing authority

Articulations may grow, contract, fork, or dissolve.
They are not specifications.
They are living boundary-objects.

Stewardship matters more than authorship.
