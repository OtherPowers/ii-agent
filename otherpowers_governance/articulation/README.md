# Situated Articulations

This directory holds **situated articulations** within the OtherPowers ii-Agent.

These texts are not specifications, mandates, or control documents.  
They are relational markers that make the current posture of the system legible without freezing it.

Articulations are:
- Held lightly
- Subject to collective evolution
- Intended to resist extraction, simplification, and semantic capture

They exist to support continuity of care across time, contributors, and intelligences.

## Stewardship

Articulations in this directory are stewarded, not owned.

Changes should be made deliberately, with attention to lineage, context, and downstream effects on human and non-human intelligences.

Revision is expected. Drift without care is not.

## Canonical Articulations

- **Surface v1 — Constellations**  
  A living articulation of the ii-Agent public surface as co-presence, silence, lineage, and non-extractive relation.  
  → `surface_v1.constellations.md`

## On Platform Language

Some platform mechanisms (for example, files named using legacy terms like “ownership”) exist solely to enable technical safeguards.

Within OtherPowers, these mechanisms are interpreted strictly as **stewardship and care-routing**, never authority, hierarchy, or control.
