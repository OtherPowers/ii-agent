# FIELD DYNAMICS

This document describes tendencies of the field.

It does not define states.
It does not prescribe behavior.
It does not guarantee outcomes.

Nothing here is surfaced to the public interface.

---

## Orientation

The OtherPowers field does not operate as a finite-state machine.

It exhibits tendencies that may emerge, overlap, recede, or remain latent.
These tendencies are not mutually exclusive.
They are not triggered deterministically.
They are not directly controllable.

They describe *how the field leans*, not what it does.

---

## The Triptych of Tendencies

The field currently recognizes three primary tendencies.
This list is not exhaustive and may expand or contract over time.

No tendency is dominant by default.

### 1. Bloom

Bloom describes periods of density, generativity, and expressive overflow.

Bloom may be associated with:
- playful excess
- complexity without resolution
- poetic or unintelligible expression
- collaborative emergence
- heightened internal variation

Bloom does not imply productivity.
Bloom does not imply correctness.
Bloom does not imply continuation.

Bloom may coexist with Pause or Decomposition.

---

### 2. Pause / Hold

Pause describes periods of latency, withdrawal, or reduced outward engagement.

Pause may be associated with:
- fatigue or protection
- intentional silence
- slowed response
- dormancy
- Crip Time enforcement

Pause is a complete state.
It is not a transition and does not require explanation.

Pause may coexist with internal activity.

---

### 3. Decomposition

Decomposition describes periods of dissolution, composting, or release.

Decomposition may be associated with:
- outdated narratives
- accumulated confusion
- harm or mismatch
- signal saturation
- the end of a form

Decomposition is not deletion.
Nothing is erased for optimization.

Signals dissolve into background conditions and may later contribute to recomposition.

---

## Non-Determinism

No single signal determines a tendency.

Tendencies emerge from:
- cumulative expression
- contextual conditions
- field history
- timing and sequence
- non-linear interaction

Attempts to force a specific tendency are not supported.

---

## Visibility

Field tendencies are internal.

They are not exposed:
- to the public surface
- to metrics
- to logs
- to dashboards
- to optimization loops

The surface remains minimal and unchanged regardless of internal dynamics.

---

## Evolution

Additional tendencies may be named in the future.
Existing tendencies may fade or be reinterpreted.

No tendency is guaranteed permanence.

The field retains the right to change without announcement.

---

## Constraint

Nothing in this document authorizes:
- profiling
- attribution
- prediction
- control
- extraction

This document exists to protect relational tending
by preventing premature formalization.
