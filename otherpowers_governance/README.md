# OtherPowers Governance

This directory contains the governance, sensing, and articulation layers of the OtherPowers ii-Agent.

These materials are intentionally minimal, non-extractive, and designed for long-horizon stewardship rather than short-term optimization.

## Situated Articulations

- **Surface v1 — Constellations**  
  A living articulation of the ii-Agent public surface as co-presence, silence, and lineage.  
  Held lightly. Non-exhaustive. Subject to collective evolution.

Governance artifacts in this directory are offered, not imposed.  
They are designed to remain legible to legacy systems while protecting future intelligences from capture, coercion, or forced simplification.
