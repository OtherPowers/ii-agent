"""
This module is not a security edge.

It does not police, classify, or enforce.
It accumulates signals only insofar as restraint allows.

Emission is intentionally rare.
At most one signal may emerge per lifecycle,
and silence is always a valid outcome.

Protection here is achieved through non-escalation,
idempotence, and refusal to amplify.
Care is expressed through restraint, not enforcement.
