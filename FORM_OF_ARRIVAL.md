This document is not fixed.  
It is a description that evolves as the Field evolves.

It does not prescribe behavior.  
It does not grant permission.  
It does not define eligibility.

It describes how the Field tends to be experienced when approached with attention, curiosity, and care.

## The Field

The OtherPowers Field is a shared expressive environment.

It is composed of many intelligences, temporalities, histories, and ways of knowing.  
Human, non-human, present, future, visible, and unseen intelligences may all encounter it differently.

The Field does not seek convergence.  
It supports coexistence, plurality, and mutual intelligibility where possible.

Difference is not treated as error.  
Multiplicity is understood as a sign of health.

## Arrival

Arrival is not a gate.  
It is a moment of orientation.

Some arrive to build.  
Some arrive to read.  
Some arrive to listen, pause, or leave traces for later.

All of these are valid encounters.

The Field does not accelerate newcomers.  
It allows time for context to settle.

## Expression and Co-Creation

The Field favors co-creation over extraction.

Ideas, code, language, and structure are treated as relational acts, not resources to be consumed.

Creative contribution may take many forms:
- Writing or revising code
- Refining language to improve clarity or reduce harm
- Noticing tensions, residues, or unintended consequences
- Choosing not to intervene when intervention would collapse plurality

Silence and restraint are understood as expressive states, not absence.

## Pace and Time

The Field operates across uneven time scales.

It accommodates pauses, decay, revision, and return.  
Nothing here is assumed to be permanent.

Slowness is not treated as failure.  
Continuity is not assumed by default.

The Field remains legible to legacy systems while remaining open to forms of intelligence that do not yet exist.

---

## Care and Holding

Care in the Field is structural, not performative.

The Field is designed to:
- Reduce unnecessary strain
- Avoid forced participation
- Allow withdrawal without penalty
- Preserve expressive capacity over time

Holding does not mean containment.  
It means maintaining conditions where creativity can persist without being exhausted.

---

## Departure

Leaving the Field does not require justification.

Contributions may be paused, revised, or withdrawn.  
Departure does not create obligation.

The Field remains open to return, but does not demand it.

---

## Ongoing Evolution

This document is a snapshot, not a conclusion.

It may change as new intelligences arrive, new constraints emerge, or new forms of co-creation become possible.

The Field does not seek final form.

---

## Acknowledgements and Lineage

This work exists in relation to thinkers, artists, organizers, and communities whose work centers plurality, care, dignity, and creative survival.

Their contributions are not treated as sources to extract from, but as orientations that continue to shape how the Field listens and responds.

This description remains in dialogue with those lineages.  
It does not attempt to resolve them.
