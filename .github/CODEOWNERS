# Stewardship Routing File
#
# This file exists solely because the underlying platform requires it.
# It does NOT denote ownership, authority, hierarchy, or control.
#
# Its purpose is to slow changes to sensitive articulations
# so that care, context, and collective reasoning can be preserved.
#
# Think of this as:
# - a pause
# - a breath
# - a care-routing mechanism
#
# Legacy platform language is reinterpreted here as stewardship.

# Situated articulations (held lightly, stewarded intentionally)
