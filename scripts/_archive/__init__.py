"""
Top-level package for OtherPowers governance.

This file exists so that Python treats `otherpowers_governance` as a package
and allows imports like:

    from otherpowers_governance.evaluations.eval_harness import ...

This module intentionally does *not* import submodules automatically to avoid
unexpected side effects during import.

If you want to expose specific functionality at the package level later,
you can add imports here explicitly.
